Your mood was cheerlessly shifting –
Look now – what a change has been!
Under a bright blue vault of heaven
Like a beautiful carpet, soft and even,
The snow glitters in sunlight;
Transparent woods are soly dark,
The firs through hoarfrost nicely sparkle
And under ice brooks’ torrents slide.
But listen, wouldn’t we desire
To ride in our open sleigh?
