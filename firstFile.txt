Last eve the blizzard howled angry,
The ghostly sky struck all and sundry,
Transparent woods are soly dark,
The firs through hoarfrost nicely sparkle
To meet the North Aurora, deeming
The Star of North, let you arise!
Last eve the blizzard howled angry,
The ghostly sky struck all and sundry,
The vapid moon was scarcely seen
Among dark drear clouds drifting;
