Hard frost and sunshine - a day of pleasure!
You are still drowsy at your leisure –
It’s time, my beauty, ope your eyes!
Let you get free of blissful dreaming,
To meet the North Aurora, deeming
The Star of North, let you arise!
Last eve the blizzard howled angry,
The ghostly sky struck all and sundry,
The vapid moon was scarcely seen
Among dark drear clouds drifting;
